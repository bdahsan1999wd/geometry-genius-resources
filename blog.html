                    <h1 class="pt-5">What is dom? And what is a purpose of dom ?</h1>
                    <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the
                        page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents
                        the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.
                    </p>

                    <h1 class="mt-5">How to select element from dom ?</h1>
                    <p>There are 5 ways in which you can select elements in a DOM using selectors. <br> <br> 1.
                        getElementsByTagName(); This method selects elements based on their tag name. It returns a
                        collection of elements that match the specified tag. <br> <br> 2. getElementById(); This method
                        selects an element based on its unique ID attribute. It returns the first element with the
                        specified ID. <br> <br> 3. getElementsByClassName(); This method selects elements based on their
                        class name. It returns a collection of elements that match the specified class. <br> <br> 4.
                        querySelector(); This method selects the first element that matches a specified CSS selector.
                        <br> <br> 5. querySelectorAll(); This method selects all the elements that match a specified CSS
                        selector.
                    </p>

                    <h1 class="mt-5">What is an event bubble?</h1>
                    <p>An event bubble is a term used in event handling in web development. In the context of the
                        Document Object Model (DOM), an event bubble refers to the propagation of an event from the
                        element where it originated to the parent elements in the hierarchy all the way up to the root
                        of the document. <br> The bubbles read-only property of the Event interface indicates whether
                        the event bubbles up through the DOM tree or not. <br> Event bubbling can be stopped using the
                        stopPropagation() method, which prevents the event from propagating further up the DOM
                        hierarchy.</p>

                    <h1 class="mt-5">What is a callback function and what does it do?</h1>
                    <p>A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is
                        executed by that function when a certain event or condition occurs. The purpose of a callback
                        function is to allow a programmer to customize the behavior of a function without having to
                        modify the function itself. <br> When a function receives a callback function as an
                        argument, it can call the callback function
                        at any time during its execution. The callback function can be used to perform additional
                        processing or to return a value to the calling function.</p>
